                            After the recent arrival of CSGO2, Valve decides to close the CSGO servers as the release 
                            of the second game in Valve's franchise has had more impact than expected and it makes no 
                            sense to maintain the servers of the first game when 99% of the players who played the first 
                            game have already who played the first game have already moved on to the second game.<br><br>

                            CSGO servers are now closed, you can no longer access from anywhere in the world.
                            and if you have the game downloaded and you have not yet updated the game to CSGO2 and you try to search for a game on the first game's servers 
                            game on the servers of the first game will indicate an error with a message saying the following 
                            following: "Lost connection to server because game has been shut down".

                            Counter-Strike 2 is official, and for some, it’s coming today. In a post on Twitter, Valve 
                            writes that a limited test for CS2 is starting today, which it describes as an “overhaul 
                            to every system, every piece of content, and every part of the C-S experience.” A website 
                            for the game describes it as “the largest technical leap forward in Counter-Strike’s history” 
                            and promises years of updates and new features..<br><br>
                            The full game is expected to release in summer 2023, according to the game’s FAQ. It will be 
                            free to play.<br><br>

                            CS2 is based on Valve’s Source 2 engine and includes updates to some of the game’s core 
                            mechanics, including improved smoke grenades and “sub-tick updates” that Valve says will 
                            let “servers know the exact instant that motion starts, a shot is fired, or a ‘nade is 
                            thrown.” (A video also appears to show someone clearing grenade smoke with another grenade.) 
                            The game will also have revamped maps, better visuals, UI enhancements, reworked audio, and more.

                            moments as S1mple, with his individual prowess, closed crucial rounds securing his team's 
                            victory.<br><br>
                            S1mple and Team TBW's achievement not only solidify their position in CS:GO's elite but also 
                            leave an indelible mark in the game's history. Fans eagerly anticipate the future accomplishments
